                            As a child, I was captivated by the world of computers and eagerly explored how to navigate them. 
                            The thrill of solving problems and crafting something new always left me in awe. 
                            I relished the challenge of mastering computer technology and software. 
                            This enduring passion eventually drove me to pursue higher education.

                            My educational journey began at Luzerne County Community College, where I discovered my true passion: software development. 
                            During my time there, I not only excelled academically, maintaining a position on the dean's list, but also took on leadership roles such as Vice President of the Computer Information Systems Club. 
                            These experiences equipped me with invaluable skills that continue to shape my career. 
                            I proudly earned my associate's degree in Computer Information Systems in May 2013.

                            Throughout my time there, I consistently earned a place on the dean's list while expanding my skill set. 
                            This experience laid a strong foundation for my career path. 
                            In December 2015, I proudly graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Sciences and Technologies.

                            A few months before completing my degree at Penn State, I embarked on a significant step in my career journey with an internship at TMG Health as a Production Coordinator. 
                            In this role, I took on the responsibility of crafting automated claims processing procedures and report automation, marking my entry into the world of professional development. 
                            Following a successful probationary period, I was offered a full-time position, allowing me to further cultivate my programming skills and knowledge.

                        <p>
                            After gaining valuable experience at TMG Health, I seized an exciting opportunity in the field of Web Development with the United States Postal Service (USPS). 
                            In 2016, I joined USPS as an Associate Analyst/Programmer, and shortly after, I was promoted to the mid-level position.

                            During my tenure at USPS, I played a crucial role in the development on a customer service and administrative application for the registration team.
                            I was responsible for its ongoing development, enhancements, and maintenance, gradually assuming full responsibility and ownership of this piece of the application.

                            As my expertise continued to expand, I was promoted to a senior level position.
                            In this role, I took on various responsibilities, including training new team members,
                            developing new functionalities, and keeping up on continuous learning through online courses
                            to keep up on the technologies we were moving toward. My expereince at USPS provided me with a robust
                            foundation in software development and a deep appreciation for teamwork.

                            In July 2022, I embarked on a new career journey by joining Learning A-Z, a private company specializing in education technology. 
                            This transition marked an exciting new challenge for me, offering opportunities for 
                            personal and professional growth within the dynamic field of educational technology.

                            modules to align with evolving customer needs. These efforts aim to provide customers with

                            developing new features for the award-winning application, Writing A-Z. This application was honored
                            with the SIIA Codie Award for Best English Language Arts Instructional Solution for Grades PK - 8.
                            The experience on this team has been immensely rewarding, allowing me to contribute to an application that is making
                            a significant impact in education.

                        processing, and was an asset to the team. His tasks included creating automated scripts based on
                        the clients needs, testing those scripts to ensure accuracy, and the daily running of those
                        scripts to ensure the claims inventory volumes were being taken care of. Chris is organized,
                        professional, and brings a good sense of humor and relaxed atmosphere to the office. Although

                        It would be a pleasure to work with Chris again, and it would be a wise decision to hire a

                        USPS, I had never experienced a professional programming environment. Chris was
                        tasked with onboarding me and made my transition from nervous “new guy” to
                        settled employee far smoother than it would've been without him. I can, without a
                        doubt, say that under his tutelage I have grown tremendously as both a programmer
                        and a person while being able to experience firsthand his commitment to providing
                        the best product he possibly can. He's passionate about his work and never
                        produces substandard code. He's a pleasure to work with and one of the biggest
                        assets to our team and company.

                    <p class="testimonialContent">I met Chris in college where we were both pursuing degrees in CIS,
                        later working as colleagues for USPS. We collaborated on various applications both in school and
                        professionally. I have turned to him for feedback on many occasions. Chris is articulate,
                        patient, and has an ever growing knowledge of web development. I have always appreciated his
                        thoughtfulness and the level of experience he was willing to share with me to help me overcome a
                        technical or coding obstacle. He is a pleasure to work with and I would happily endorse him as
                        an addition to any team.
