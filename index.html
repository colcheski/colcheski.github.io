                <div>
                    <p>As a child I always loved learning how to use my parents computer. Figuring out how to solve a
                        problem or create something new always amazed me. I enjoyed the challenge of learning ways to
                        use computers and software. Years later, this passion lead me to seek out secondary education

                        <h3>College</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>I started my secondary education journey at Luzerne County Community College. There, I learned
                        what I really wanted to do. I wanted to be a software developer. In my time there, I became vice
                        president of the Computer Information Systems Club, maintained the dean's list, and learned a
                        lot of key skills that would help me throughout my career. I received my associate's degree in
                        Computer Information Systems in May of 2013.</p>
                    <b>PARALLAX IMAGE OF LCC DEGREE OR SOMETHING</b>
                    <p>Before graduating from my associate's degree program, I knew I wanted to further my education. I
                        moved on to Penn State University to continue learning. There I maintained dean's list while
                        learning even more vital skills to set me forth on my career journey. I graduated with a
                        Bachelor's Degree in Information Sciences and Technologies in December of 2015</p>

                        <h3>Career</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>A few months prior to graduating Penn State, I started an internship with TMG Health as a
                        Production Coordinator. I was responsible for creating automated claims processing processes, as
                        well as automation of reports.
                        This was my first foray into the world of development as a career. After probation, I was hired
                        on full time as I continued to learn and develop my skillset for programming.
                    </p>
                    <b>PARALLAX IMAGE OF SOMETHING LIKE USPS</b>
                    <p>I found an opportunity to do Web Development at the United States Postal Service after some time
                        passed at TMG. I was hired as an associate analyst/programmer in 2016. Shortly after that I was
                        promoted to mid-level within my first year. I continued my hunt for a stronger skill set and
                        suring up weaknesses in my career since then. I've worked on a customer service and
                        administrative application since then coming up from the bottom to being in charge of the whole
                        application. More recently I was promoted to a Senior level programmer and have done a fair bit
                        of training new people, creating new pieces of functionality, and learning.</p>
