                        <p>As a child I always loved learning how to use my parents computer. Figuring out
                            how
                            to solve a
                            problem or create something new always amazed me. I enjoyed the challenge of learning ways
                            to
                            use computers and software. Years later, this passion lead me to seek out secondary
                            education

                        <p>I started my secondary education journey at Luzerne County Community College.
                            There,
                            I learned
                            what I really wanted to do. I wanted to be a software developer. In my time there, I became
                            vice
                            president of the Computer Information Systems Club, maintained the dean's list, and learned
                            a
                            lot of key skills that would help me throughout my career. I received my associate's degree
                            in
                            Computer Information Systems in May of 2013.</p>

                            moved on to Penn State University to continue learning. There I maintained dean's list while
                            learning even more vital skills to set me forth on my career journey. I graduated with a
                            Bachelor's Degree in Information Sciences and Technologies in December of 2015</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>A few months prior to graduating Penn State, I started an internship with TMG Health as a
                            Production Coordinator. I was responsible for creating automated claims processing
                            processes, as
                            well as automation of reports.
                            This was my first foray into the world of development as a career. After probation, I was
                            hired
                            on full time as I continued to learn and develop my skillset for programming.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fadeUp">
                        <p>I found an opportunity to do Web Development at the United States Postal Service after some
                            time
                            passed at TMG. I was hired as an associate analyst/programmer in 2016. Shortly after that I
                            was
                            promoted to mid-level within my first year. I continued my hunt for a stronger skill set and
                            suring up weaknesses in my career since then. I've worked on a customer service and
                            administrative application since then coming up from the bottom to being in charge of the
                            whole
                            application. More recently I was promoted to a Senior level programmer and have done a fair
                            bit
                            of training new people, creating new pieces of functionality, and learning.</p>

                        full time job if certain criteria were met. He did well in the program and was quickly offered a
                        position on my team. Chris was able to really get involved in the automation of medical claims
                        processing, and was an asset to the team. His tasks included creating automated scripts based on
                        the clients needs, testing those scripts to ensure accuracy, and the daily running of those
                        scripts to ensure the claims inventory volumes were being taken care of. Chris is organized,
                        professional, and brings a good sense of humor and relaxed atmosphere to the office. Although
                        Chris eventually moved on, he was professional in his exit by assisting his team with his daily
                        tasks and training them with what needed to be done daily prior to starting his new job.
                        It would be a pleasure to work with Chris again, and it would be a wise decision to hire a
                        person of Chris's caliber.

                        working
                        alongside Chris Olcheski as his subordinate for nearly 3 years. Coming into the

                        tasked with onboarding me and made my transition from nervous “new guy” to
                        settled employee far smoother than it would've been without him. I can, without a
                        doubt, say that under his tutelage I have grown tremendously as both a programmer
                        and a person while being able to experience firsthand his commitment to providing
                        the best product he possibly can. He's passionate about his work and never
                        produces substandard code. He's a pleasure to work with and one of the biggest
