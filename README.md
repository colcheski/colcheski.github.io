need to move script loading to the bottom of the body as this is a best practice

Fix Display Issues:
Possibly change top picture
Need to decide if we want to use background gradient or not (commenting it for now)
If so need to decide on coloring and inset colors (may need to change them dynamically with javascript if we go this route)
Want to put thick white lines around the box surrounding the introduction (not the text)
Need to get the rest of the testimonials (send out message to possibly tom and rich to see if they'll write ones for me)
Need to figure out what email to put on website (if i can get one with domain name)

This can be used for making image follow mouse cursor (email and linkedin)
